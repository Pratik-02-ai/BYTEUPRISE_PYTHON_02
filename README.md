#BYTEUPRISE_PYTHON_02


I developed a Library Management System in Python to efficiently manage books, users, and transactions within a library. The system provides core functionalities such as:

Adding, updating, and deleting books

User registration and book issue/return tracking

Search functionality for books by title or author

Data persistence using file handling or a database (e.g., SQLite)

This project strengthened my skills in:

Python object-oriented programming (OOP)

CRUD operations and data management

CLI-based user interaction

File I/O or database integration

A practical project that simulates real-world library operations while applying structured programming principles.
